O hi sorry I'm doing alright with the research project so far. My research was mainly around the Pink vs Blue, Green vs Red and Blue vs Red and I was liikung to the the cultural reason we used these colors

	
colmoneill

the two pages there are, I think, quite related to your work

I wanted to do my project on something that encompassed all these topics because their so diverse and settle for the use of color across culture after finding out the japan uses blue lights insted of green for traffic

The Diverse meanings of Color across culture or something like that. would that make sense for this project

?

Yes that sounds on point indeed, so long as you're interested in the subject!

I attached two more screenshots there from a book called 100 things designers should know

Specifically on the different meaning of colours in different cultures

hope these bits and pieces help

Those will definitely be helpful I was also exploring how color can effect mood and came across a research paper about how athletes in red are more likely to perform better cos the color encourages competitiveness. Thank you for the sources

it's tricky jay

I'm not sure exactly what is going on

the position fixed on your banner is not really helping

I'm still on it

	
jaysimz
Update your status
10:08 AM
I can change it to relative if that will help

	
colmoneill
10:11 AM
Yes, I thinkg I'll be sending back code with that in relative

What is the logic behind the transforms translates  in the banner ?

	
jaysimz
Update your status
10:12 AM
It was to position the navigation bar

	
colmoneill
10:12 AM

Things kept moving around and I wasn't sure how to put it in the exact position I wanted it to be

yeah, using absolute and translates will come back to bite you when making responsive websites...
